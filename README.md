# Janelia ML Course - lecture 1

## Exercises and milestones for lab 1

### Intro Python and programming
1. Have Anaconda (conda) installed
2. git-clone this repository
3. Open and run the Lecture_1.ipynb notebook

### Linear regression
1. Read [this website about the diabetes dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html)
2. and [this website sklearn's Linear Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)
3. Add one or more new features from the dataset, and solve using sklearn's LinearRegression
4. Set up the matrix equation for linear regression with two features
5. Solve the linear system and make sure the results are the same as those you got with sklearn

### Bayes / Naive bayes
1. Run the document classification Naive Bayes example.
2. Play around with it - there are more than two classes.

### Probability / statistics
1. Derive Bayes rule. (Hint: start with the equation relating joint distribution to a conditional distribution)
2. Spot and understand the "mistake" on the **Intuition -> math -> stats** slide

### Linear algebra
1. if AB=I, then is it the case that BA=I?
2. What is the solution to the 2x2 matrix equation in the slides?
