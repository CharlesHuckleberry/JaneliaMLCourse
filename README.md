# Janelia ML Course - lecture 1

## Exercises and milestones for lab 1

### Intro Python and programming
1. Have Anaconda (conda) installed
2. git-clone this repository
3. Open and run the Lecture_1.ipynb notebook

### Linear regression
1. Read [this website about the diabetes dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes.html)
2. and [this website sklearn's Linear Regression](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression)
3. Add one or more new features from the dataset, and solve using sklearn's LinearRegression
4. Set up the matrix equation for linear regression with two features
5. Solve the linear system and make sure the results are the same as those you got with sklearn
